### What to expect

__TweakStyle is in an early stage__. REALLY

Some features are not yet implemented, others need to be improved. Don't expect something completely ready for end user.<br>
The purpose of this Beta is to let you feel the spirit of TweakStyle and to get your opinion.<br>
Your feedback is important and will help us to prioritise and orientate the development.

- What do you find the most cool, valuable?
- What things should be added / improved first?
- What is lacking for your usage?

### Documentation

You can check the [wiki](https://github.com/TweakStyle/BetaFeedback/wiki)<br>
For now the documentation is very poor. We'll try to improve it as soon as we'll find the time to.<br>
Feel free to complete it or improve it
